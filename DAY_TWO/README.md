## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) or command line

### Compilation and Execution

#### Using Command Line:
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Compile all Java files
javac DayTwo/*.java

# Run the main program
java DayTwo.Main
```

#### Using IDE:
1. Import the project into your IDE
2. Ensure the package structure is correct
3. Run `Main.java` as the entry point

## üìö Concepts Covered

### 1. Decision Making
- **Conditional Statements**: if, if-else, nested if
- **Switch Statements**: Traditional and enhanced switch
- **Ternary Operator**: Conditional expressions
- **Grade System**: Practical implementation

### 2. Jump Statements
- **Break**: Loop termination and switch cases
- **Continue**: Skip current iteration
- **Return**: Method termination with/without values
- **Labeled Statements**: Advanced loop control

### 3. Loops
- **For Loop**: Counter-controlled repetition
- **While Loop**: Condition-controlled repetition
- **Do-While Loop**: Post-test loops
- **Enhanced For Loop**: Collection iteration
- **Nested Loops**: Multi-dimensional iterations

### 4. Operators
- **Arithmetic**: Mathematical operations
- **Relational**: Comparison operations
- **Logical**: Boolean operations
- **Bitwise**: Bit-level operations
- **Assignment**: Value assignment variations
- **Unary**: Single operand operations
